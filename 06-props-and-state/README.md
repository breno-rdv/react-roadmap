# Props and state

## Props
Props is the shorthand for Properties in React. They are read-only variables that must be kept pure.

This helps maintaining unidirectional flow and are mostly used to render dynamic content.

It is passed by a parent component, you can think of being a function parameter.

## State
State, on the other hand, is a mutable variable that is controlled by the enclosing component.

Once you pass the state to a child component, it becomes a prop of this child component.
