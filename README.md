# react-roadmap
Code examples for React concepts as a guide for mentees

## Introduction
These examples aim to get into the nitty gritty details of React ecosystem.
Each section covers one topic and is composed by a code example and a documentation
explaining it.

## Running the project
Open a terminal and in the root folder type `./start.sh` or `sh start.sh`,
it will open up a browser and then you can navigate to related code example.
